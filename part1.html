<p class="mb-6 text-xl md:text-2xl uppercase">Overall, I like music because it can generate such a strong emotional response, but I think EDM can do that, especially with its charming melody and charming beat.</p>
<p class="mb-4 text-lg">EDC's full name is Electric Daisy Carnival, the world's largest electronic music festival. EDC is also a worldwide music festival, held in many places around the world. The EDC in Vegas is part of the best and most rewarding. As a very comprehensive music festival, in addition to music stage, there are many other amusement facilities (jumping machine, ferries wheel, swing, bumper car, etc.) The stage has seven stages, which surround the entire Las Vegas motor speedway circuit, and all the music, lighting, and pyrotechnics is perfectly timed. The sound equipment is really, really good, and even amazing. Music sounds very loud, but you can hear it very clearly and comfortably in either direction of the stage. The mammoth venue had almost no effect on sound quality. And music on every stage has very little interference. With the right lighting effect and fireworks, it just feels like the whole thing is lit!</p>

<p class="mb-4 text-lg">Most of the girls dress like this, but it's sexy and very slight because Vegas is so hot! People are very elaborately decorated. There will be a lot of fluorescence or blingbling decoration here will feel that everything is taken for granted. There is not any feeling of sexual immorality or unnatural. The feeling is to return to the true. All people are very innocent of the release of their own. No paper tickets are available for admission, and all people have an obligation to wear green hand bands before entering. The organizer will send a box with stickers, brochures and other small items in addition to the bracelet.</p>

<p class="mb-4 text-lg">There are very strict security checks before entering, and almost no medicine is allowed. There are also many medical stations in the field, if there is an issue can be solved as soon as possible. Alcohol is available, drugs are prohibited, and you can still smell the heavy smell of marijuana. Everyone seems to get more immersed in their own world, drinking alcohol and drugs to cheer up. No one in the EDC has been shot or injured this year because of heavy drug and alcohol use. Every night hundreds of thousands of people gather on the same grounds, many of them sitting casually in the middle of the road when they are tired, even though no stampede has happened for three days.</p>

<p class="mb-4 text-3xl md:text-2xl uppercase"> TIPS </p>
<p class="text-base">1.It's better to go early than to go late</p>
<p class="text-sm">The EDC of Las Vegas is typically in May, with three consecutive days. From sunset to sunrise, it starts at 7.30pm each night and ends around 5am the next day. As far as physical strength is concerned, it is impossible to participate from the beginning to end. Go early and leave early to prevent traffic jams. Traffic jams are very scary. We hire a car this time. We usually start at around 9pm and arrive around 1am.</p>

<p class="text-base">2.Water bag</p>
<p class="text-sm">The bottled water inside is very expensive, about 5-6 bottles. There is a special free water station in the venue. The advantages of water bags, in addition to a lot of water, can also be used as a small bag to place some change and bank CARDS, very practical.</p>

<p class="text-base"> 3.Choose your vehicle wisely and remember your parking space</p>
<p class="text-sm">There will be shuttle buses to the scene from the city, or uber. The advantage is that it's easy to get there without getting stuck in traffic. The disadvantage is just very difficult when you come back. Both uber and shuttle are required to wait. It is a horrible thing to wait for the bus when you are very tired. If you drive your own car, in addition to traffic jams, more important is probably in the parking lot, can not find the car!! There could be hundreds of thousands of cars flooding into the parking lot at the same time, and at night, it's important to remember your parking location, and it's best to plug a balloon into the car so you can see it from afar. It doesn't matter if you're a tuhao. Because you can rent a helicopter! Not afraid of traffic jam, also not afraid of the car can not find, can come at any time, can get out at any time ~</p>
