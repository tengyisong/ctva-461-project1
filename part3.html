<h2 class="mb-1 text-xl md:text-2xl uppercase">My Experience at Tomorrowland 2018 Belgium</h2>
<p>Tomorrowland is often dubbed as the king of all EDM festivals since the production and lineups are usually top notch. Attending this festival has been on my rave bucket list for years, but I have never really been able to go due to the cost of international travel as well as saving up a few weeks to take off from work. After watching countless after movies in 2017, my husband and I vowed to make 2018 the year of Tomorrowland! Side note, I plan on creating a series of blogs around Tomorrowland including what it was like to camp in DreamVille as well as my thoughts on traveling via Tomorrowland’s Discover Europe package. Without further adieu, let’s dive into my experience at Tomorrowland 2018 Belgium – The Story of Planaxis!</p>
<h2 class="mb-1 text-xl md:text-2xl uppercase">Traveling to Tomorrowland</h2>
<p>There are a ton of ways to get to Tomorrowland, but we chose to travel via Global Journey. It’s a package you can book with Tomorrowland that ensures you a ticket to the festival and gives you a chance to travel beforehand with other festival goers. A blog about all of this is coming soon! You can also try your luck at getting tickets to Tomorrowland, but it’s extremely difficult. Anyway, we arrived to Tomorrowland from Antwerp, Belgium by bus. It was about 45 minutes away as Tomorrowland is held in a tiny town called Boom. It’s super cute and all the residents put Tomorrowland flags up in their windows! If you aren’t camping in DreamVille, your other option is to book a Tomorrowland themed hotel or to rent an Airbnb. Something that I found unique was how the whole world is pretty much represented at this festival. Tomorrowland is really proud of this and they give everyone who participates in the Discover Europe or Discover Belgium package a flag to wear or carry at the festival, so it’s a fun way to see where everyone is coming from!</p>
