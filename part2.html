    <p class="mb-4 md:text-xl">In today’s society, EDM (electric dance music) has become one of the top trending music across the world and if you have not yet attend one of these event, it’s time for you to act now.  I have been able to manage sometime off during the last spring break and actually went to one of the biggest music festival at Miami, Florida which is call Ultra Music Festival (UMF).  I was so excited that I can finally make it happened since it’s at the other side of country which requires a bit of travel and also it happened to be the 20th year anniversary of UMF.</p>
    <p class=" mb-4 md:text-xl">Before I headed to Florida and the plane itself, I began to wonder what it would be to be in Miami. I'm the virgin of Miami music week and ultra music festival, so I make sure to minimize predetermined concepts and ideas before attending any part of my trip. Scanning the lineup, I saw some serious behavior I had never imagined before, and the Live Stage was the guy who caught my eye. There are plenty of artists making their debuts that I've never seen before, and certainly a lot of artists that I've already known and loved. As far as the lineup goes, I think Ultra did a fantastic job bringing some quality performances, but more will come later.</p>
    <p class=" mb-4 md:text-xl">The festival is located at the Bayfront Park which is in the central of downtown Miami and surrounded by all high rise building hotels that everybody can easily get there without take too much time of driving. It is 3 days event from 12 p.m. to 12 a.m. daily and the festival features total 8 different stages with live steaming on radio and youtube.  And of course, there are more than 100 top DJs from all over the world that got invited to the festival to share their new albums with their dedicated fans and celebrate the big days (birthday, engagement day and etc.) together under the electric music sky.  It is awesome experience for me to be part of it, and seen everyone from all over the world dance together and hug each other whether they know each other or just a stranger that next to them.</p>
    <p class=" mb-4 md:text-xl"> And I still remember clearly that one of my favor DJ Armin Van Buuren has said, we are all from different countries, we are all different nationalities, but doesn’t matter what we are, who we are, today we are united, we are the same people, we are all here to listen to what we love, what we passion for and be the person that we want to be.  It was so touched at that moment that I have actually even seen many people cried and of course with the smile on their face at the same time as well.  And that just literally pressed the softest part of my heart and made me believed that people really can spread out the love and share it with anyone in any kind of way and of course music is one of the best way to do so, it can easily makes people feel they are connected even though one second ago they were still stranger to each other. Now at the end of day, all I want to say is this trip has made a significant changes on how I look at these music festival and it is one good time experience that I can always share with others in the future.  And I will keep continue to attend these phenomenal events in the future and explore the world of electric dance music more and more.</p>
    <p class=" mb-4 md:text-xl">One of the things that seem to be one of the most discussed things in my world is the resonance of the holidays, which are generally negative. But in my experience, I really disagree with that assessment. Not everyone is unhappy, mean, rude or anything like that. Of course, there were times when I had some deleterious interactions with crowds and tight squeezes, and I did notice there were also some very aggressive guys. I do think people should say sorry, or sorry. If they're going to squeeze through, but I think there's only so much that can be done. While my range may be limited because I focus on stages that aren't major, I really feel that the vast majority of people I interact with are very good. Whether they were random people I was dancing with at the time, new friends made through old friends, or people who attended the event, I really didn't have the adverse time that many others cried on social media. Maybe, just maybe, you have to push out the vibrations you want to receive and find a way to deal with the limping situation.</p>
